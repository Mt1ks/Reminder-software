# Reminder-software
Simple program written in C++ that reminds the user to do tasks after a period of time specified by the user.

1.2 Update note:
The "Alarm_Sound.wav" file must be in the same folder as the base "Reminder me" exe file for the sound to play once it should. For ease of access to the file without the need of placing the sound file in your desktop, i recommend making a shortcut.
